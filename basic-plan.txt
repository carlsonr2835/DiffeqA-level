hello this is a test

getting input is half the battle:

We are changing this project project to finding eigen vectors and eigen values and classifying the type of equilibrium solution


we will have some kind of beefy function that will interpret all the input
it will guide user over what to input when


Vector of strings, each element is a term
a vector of operands 


in main, function that gets each term and assigns to member variables in the class.
Class is templated? to account for decimals?
